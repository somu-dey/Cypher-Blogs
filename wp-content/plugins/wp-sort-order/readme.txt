[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pLHSAALbGw]

= How to enable sorting for posts/pages and taxonomies with this plugin? =

On settings page you can select posts/pages and taxonomies to enable sorting.

= Can users be sorted with this plugin? =

Yes, you can sort. And there is a shortcode to list users under taxonomy, terms and children. [WPSO_USERS slug="taxonomy or term slug" id="taxonomy or term id"]. This shortcode will list users on front-end with your sorted order. No need to write another query for it.

= How to re-override the parameters of 'orderby' and 'order' =

<strong>Sub query</strong>

By using the 'WP_Query', you can re-override the parameters.

* WP_Query

`
<?php $query = new WP_Query( array(
	'orderby' => 'date',
	'order' => 'DESC',
) ) ?>
`

<strong>Main query</strong>

By using the 'pre_get_posts' action hook or 'query_posts()', you can re-override the parameters.

* pre_get_posts

`
function my_filter( $query )
{
	if ( is_admin() || !$query->is_main_query() ) return;
	if ( is_home() ) {
		$query->set( 'orderby', 'date' );
		$query->set( 'order', 'DESC' );
		return;
	}
}
add_action( 'pre_get_posts', 'my_filter' );
`

* query_posts()

`
<?php query_posts( array(
	'orderby' => 'rand'
) ); ?>
